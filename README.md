# We need to interact with the following during installation:

 # We will be asked to review the licence agreement. After pressing return/enter, we can view it and hit the space bar to advance. At the bottom, we need to type in yes to accept.
 # It will then ask if the location is ok, hitting enter will place it in our current home directory, which is usually great.
 # At the end it will ask if we want to update our shell profile to automatically initialize conda.
 # There might be reasons to not want to do this, but until we hit one of those reasons, for most users itâ€™s easist just to say yes to that.
